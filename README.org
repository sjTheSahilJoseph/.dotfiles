***** Everyone has different way of using computers, It's my way.
***** Feel free to use if you want.

* Computer Style
** Philosophy
1. Use computer 100% powerfully, productively, and fastly.
    - Do what is needed, don't waste time in doing unnecessary stuff.
		- Create your own tools and utilities.
2. Customize almost all things.
	- But make sure to not change the whole meaning of that thing.
		- For example, Emacs, don't just create unnecessary keybindings.
		- But create own keymaps to work faster.

** Tools I use
**** Operating System
Windows 11 - x64
	
** Fonts
1. Emacs
    - Consolas - Size = 13pt

** Personal Points:
    - In code writing, I don't like heavy syntax highliting.
    - Don't use Code auto completion, etc.. (Use documentation).
		- Text editor should be Emacs
		- For C/C++ Development keep open Visual Studio (IDE)
		- For Web Development keep open Visual Studio Code
		- For Python Development keep open PyCharm
		But use Emacs for writing code
    - I like fat box cursor, 500ms Blinking
	(complete one blink in 1 sec, 500ms off 500ms on).
    - Turn off almost all animations in Operating System.

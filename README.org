* SJ's Dotfiles
***** Everyone has different way of using computers, It's my way.
***** Feel free to use if you want.

* Setup:
*** mklink -> Windows

* Computer Style
** Philosophy
1. Use computer 100% powerfully, productively, and fastly.
    - Do what is needed, don't waste time in doing unnecessary stuff.
		- Create your own tools and utilities.
2. Customize almost all things.
	- But make sure to not change the whole meaning of that thing.
		- For example, Emacs, don't just create unnecessary keybindings.
		- But create own keymaps to work faster.

** Tools I use
**** Operating System
Windows 11 - x64
Linux - Fedora
**** Code Editor
Emacs
**** IDEs
- I write code in Emacs but I like to keep IDE open while writing code.
***** C/C++

** Personal Points:
    - I don't like heavy syntax highliting.
    - Use LSP, but don't use autocomplete, suggestions, or flymake or flycheck stuff (Use documentation) for code, and terminal for errors.
      - LSP manager as Eglot
    - I like fat box cursor, 500ms Blinking	(complete one blink in 1 sec, 500ms off 500ms on).
    - Turn off almost all animations in Operating System.

* SJ's Dotfiles
***** Everyone has different way of using computers, It's my way.
***** Feel free to use if you want.

* Setup:
*** mklink -> Windows
*** symlink -> Linux
*** Install all the tools and stuff

* Computer Style
** Philosophy
1. Use computer 100% powerfully, productively, and fastly.
    - Do what is needed, don't waste time in doing unnecessary stuff.
		- Create your own tools and utilities.
2. Customize almost all things.
	- But make sure to not change the whole meaning of that thing.
		- For example, Emacs, don't just create unnecessary keybindings.
		- But create own keymaps to work faster.

** Tools I use
**** Operating System
Windows 11 - x64
Linux - Fedora
**** Code Editor
Emacs
**** IDEs
- I write code in Emacs but I like to keep IDE open while writing code.
***** C/C++
- Visual Studio (IDE) as kind of debugger and more information about project.
- Emacs for writing code
- Just keep open Visual Studio and Emacs, use both
***** Web Development
- Visual Studio Code for Frontend Development
- Emacs for Writing Logic Code
- Keep VS Code and Emacs open, use both
***** Python
- No IDE, just basic Emacs with Terminal
- Or Jupyter Notebook
***** Android Development
- Andriod Studio (with emacs bindings)
  - Here write code in Android Studio for better code writing experience
***** Game Development
- Visual Studio IDE just keep open for more informations
- Emacs for Writing Code
- Unity Engine for Game Creation
- Unreal Engine for Game Creation
- Custom Engine for Game Creation
**** Browser
***** Microsoft Edge
- Sync across all devices
**** Office Tools
***** Microsoft Office
- Almost for everything professionally
***** Google Docs, Spreadsheet, Keep Notes, Org Mode
- Personal Stuff
    
	
** Fonts
***** Consolas - Size = 13pt / 17px

** Personal Points:
    - I don't like heavy syntax highliting.
    - Use LSP, but don't use autocomplete, suggestions, or flymake or flycheck stuff (Use documentation) for code, and terminal for errors and IDE for linting stuff.
      Emacs just to write code.
      - LSP manager as Eglot
    - I like fat box cursor, 500ms Blinking	(complete one blink in 1 sec, 500ms off 500ms on).
    - No major problem with software animations, until and unless these are too slow.

***** Everyone has different way of using computers, It's my way.
***** Feel free to use if you want.

*** Install all the tools and stuff

* Computer Style
** Philosophy
1. Use computer 100% powerfully, productively, and fastly.
    - Do what is needed, don't waste time in doing unnecessary stuff.
		- Create your own tools and utilities.
2. Customize almost all things.
	- But make sure to not change the whole meaning of that thing.
		- For example, Emacs, don't just create unnecessary keybindings.
		- But create own keymaps to work faster.

** Personal Points:
    - I don't like heavy syntax highliting.
    - I don't use LSP in Emacs. I use emacs just to write code. Other stuff on IDE.
    - I like box, like normal box cursor, 500ms Blinking	(complete one blink in 1 sec, 500ms off 500ms on).
    - No major problem with software animations, until and unless they are too slow.

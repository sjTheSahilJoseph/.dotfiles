* Computer Style
** Philosophy
1. Use computer 100% powerfully, productively, and fastly.
    - Do what is needed, don't waste time in doing unnecessary stuff.
		- Create your own tools and utilities.
2. Only customize those things that matters, don't waste time.
	- But make sure to not change the whole meaning of that thing.
		- For example, Emacs, don't just create unnecessary keybindings.

** Fonts
***** Liberation Mono - Size = 13pt / 17px / 130 emacs height

** Personal Points:
    - No major problem with software animations, until and unless they are too slow.
    - I use Dark Theme for almost everything, But for emacs, I use light theme.

** Emacs Points:
- No LSP, No code suggestion, no linting, no fancy stuff.
- Use IDE for these kind of things, use Emacs as a plain code editor.
- Use light theme for emacs. (loveisanillusion by sjthesahiljoseph).

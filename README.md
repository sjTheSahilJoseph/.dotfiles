# SJ's Dotfiles
These are my .dotfiles

# Computer Style
Everyone has different style of using computer, or working on computer.
This is my style of working with computers.

## Philosophy
1. Use computer 100% powerfully, productively, and fastly.
    - Do what is needed, don't waste time in doing unnecessary stuff.
		- I mean create your own tools and utilities.
2. Customize almost all things.
	- But make sure to not change the whole meaning of that thing.
		- For example, Emacs, don't just create unnecessary keybindings.
		- But create own keymaps to work faster.

## Tools I use
1. I use Microsoft Windows 11
	- Windows 11
	
# Fonts
1. Emacs
    - Consolas - Size = 12pt

# Personal Points
    - In code writing, I don't like heavy syntax highliting.
    - Don't use Code auto completion, etc.. (Use documentation).
		- Text editor should be Emacs
		- For C/C++ Development keep open Visual Studio (IDE)
		- For Web Development keep open Visual Studio Code
		- For Python Development keep open PyCharm
		But use Emacs for writing code
    - I like beam cursor, no need to enable blinking, just turn off blinking.
    - Turn of all animations, and sounds, etc...
    

## Feel Free to use them If you want to.
Have a great day.
